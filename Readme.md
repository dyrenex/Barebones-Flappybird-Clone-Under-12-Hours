Bare-bones Flappybird Clone Under 12 Hours
=========================================

Introduction
------------

I challenged myself to create a simple bare-bones Flappybird clone in SFML
within 12 hours. I had recently picked up the library and wanted to create
a quick project for myself to do.

This is the first project I had ever done in SFML coding along books for
SFML.
